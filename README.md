# eplan
Educational programming language for compiler construction teaching

EPlan is used to teach compilation techniques to undergraduate
students at Universidade Federal de Ouro. The language specification
starts with a very minimal kernel and grows with new features as new
techniques are learnt.

Tags will be used to give access to each important stage of the
compiler implementation.
